## 🔍overview 
Manufacturing downtime refers to periods when production stops due to equipment failures, maintenance, supply chain disruptions, or operational inefficiencies. Downtime can be categorized into two types: planned (e.g., scheduled maintenance) and unplanned (e.g., unexpected breakdowns). While planned downtime is necessary for upkeep, unplanned downtime leads to significant losses in productivity, increased costs, and delays in manufacturing processes.


## 🎯Project Goal
The goal of this project is to analyze downtime occurrences in the manufacturing process, identify root causes, and provide actionable insights to minimize production interruptions. By leveraging historical data, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling, we aim to improve overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) and reduce lost production time.
## ❗Problem Statement
Unplanned downtime leads to significant production losses, increased operational costs, and inefficiencies. The lack of data-driven insights makes it challenging to pinpoint key failure points and optimize maintenance schedules.
## 📋Scope of Work
-	Analyze frequency, duration, and trends in downtime events.
-	Provide visualization dashboards and reports for decision-making.

## ❓Key Questions 
- How often does downtime occur in each production line?
- What is the total downtime duration per day, week, or month?
- What is the average downtime per machine?
- What are the top reasons for downtime? (e.g., machine failure, operator error, material shortage)
- Are there patterns in downtime causes across shifts or departments?
- How does downtime affect production output?
- What is the impact of downtime on overall equipment efficiency (OEE)?
- What percentage of production time is lost due to downtime?
- Can we predict when a machine is likely to fail?
- Which factors contribute most to downtime risk?
- How can preventive maintenance be optimized to reduce downtime?
- What are the trends in downtime across machines, shifts, and causes?
